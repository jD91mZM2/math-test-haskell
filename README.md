# Math parser for fun

## What is this?

It's a rewrite of my badly-named program ["simple-math"](https://github.com/jD91mZM2/simple-math), written in Haskell.

## Why is this?

Because fun.  
Rust is easier, faster, and more efficient.  
I don't care, I wanted to learn Haskell.

## When is this?

Here's a checklist on what's done:

 - [x] Arbritary-length ("big") numbers. (Thanks to library "Decimal")
 - [x] Decimal numbers
 - [x] Factorial
 - [x] Groups (Parenthesis)
 - [x] Negative numbers
 - [x] Order of operation
 - [x] Proper parser (tokenize -> parse -> evaluate)
 - [ ] Binary/Octal/Hexadecimal
 - [ ] Bitwise operators
 - [ ] Function system
 - [ ] Variables
